### Project Specification: Homebuilding Business Model Simulation Tool

#### **Project Title:**
Loan Management and Cash Flow Simulation for a Homebuilding Business

---

#### **Objective:**
Develop a simulation tool that models the financial performance of a homebuilding business under specified conditions. The tool will accurately reflect loan balances, cash on hand, construction timelines, and profit accumulation based on user-defined parameters. The simulation must halt borrowing once cash on hand is sufficient to fund construction costs and dynamically adjust based on profits.

#### **Key Deliverables:**
1. **Dynamic Financial Model:**
   - Simulate monthly financial metrics, including:
     - Cash on hand
     - Loan balance
     - Houses under construction
     - Houses completed
     - Profit accumulated
   - Reflect loan repayment as soon as cash becomes available.
   - Halt borrowing entirely when cash on hand is sufficient to fund construction.

2. **Input Parameters:**
   - Initial loan amount (e.g., $320,000)
   - Construction cost per square foot (e.g., $175)
   - Selling price per square foot (e.g., $250)
   - House size (e.g., 2000 square feet)
   - Construction timeline (e.g., 5 months)

3. **Simulation Outputs:**
   - A tabular monthly summary of financial metrics.
   - Clearly defined logic to track:
     - Loan usage and repayment
     - Cash utilization for new constructions
     - Profit accumulation.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Graphical representations of:
     - Cash on hand over time
     - Loan balance over time
     - Number of houses under construction and completed over time.

5. **Validation & Error Handling:**
   - Confirm accuracy of all calculations.
   - Handle edge cases (e.g., when profits temporarily dip below required construction costs).

#### **Scope and Requirements:**

1. **Logic Implementation:**
   - Define the rules for:
     - Construction completion and profit realization.
     - Borrowing only when cash is insufficient to start a house.
     - Paying down loans as cash becomes available.
   - Automate the cessation of borrowing once cash flow sustains the business.

2. **Automation:**
   - Automate the process of loan repayment using available cash.
   - Automate construction scheduling based on financial metrics.

3. **Testing Framework:**
   - Build unit tests to validate:
     - Loan balance behavior.
     - Proper utilization of cash for construction.
     - Correct profit realization and accumulation.

4. **Technical Requirements:**
   - Language: Python (preferred for data analysis and simulation).
   - Libraries:
     - **Pandas** for data handling.
     - **Matplotlib** or similar for visualization.
     - **Numpy** for efficient calculations.
   - Output Format: DataFrame for tabular results, optionally exportable to CSV/Excel.
